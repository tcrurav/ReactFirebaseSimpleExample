## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

Create a Firebase project and create a Real-time database in that project.

Import some fake data in your database to start up. Here you have some:
[Some data to import to Firebase](/docs/reactbikes-default-rtdb-export.json)

Clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/ReactFirebaseSimpleExample.git
```

Now install all dependencies.

```
cd ReactFirebaseSimpleExample
npm install
```

Modify the constant firebaseConfig in file src/firebase.js so that it contains the corresponding configuration data of your project. Here you have an example:

```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyBL83k7hQlfWWYFsjV4qIqAwFyTNV3Csds",
  authDomain: "reactbikes.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://reactbikes-default-rtdb.europe-west1.firebasedatabase.app",
  projectId: "reactbikes",
  storageBucket: "reactbikes.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "120470000752",
  appId: "1:120470000752:web:e3ce490552fcc96fe750b5"
};
```

And finally run the project.

```
cd ReactFirebaseSimpleExample
npm start
```

Enjoy!!!
